                      Nonprofits seeking 501(c)(3) tax exempt status should be aware of the IRS “27-month” rule.<sup title="The IRS updates its tax-exempt organization applications annually and often tinkers with them during the year. The most recent version is here Proc. Rev 2017-5, available at  https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-01_IRB/ar11.html.">1</sup> This is an IRS stopwatch that starts the moment a nonprofit is “formed.” (More on "formed," below.)<br><br>
                      <b>The rule.</b> The IRS gives a new 501(c) 27-months from the end of the month that it was formed to submit IRS Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to be recognized as tax exempt.<sup title="Just about everyone&mdash;including the IRS&mdash;often says that the IRS “grants” tax exemption. Technically the IRS only either recognizes or refuses to recognize tax exemption. <i>Congress</i> grants tax-exemption through statutes.">2</sup> This requirement applies to 501(c) organizations in general.
                      <br><hr><br>
                      <b>Example.</b> Suppose Charitable Doings, an Oregon nonprofit corporation, is formed on June 14, 2000. The 27-month clock automatically starts on June 30 (the end of that month). The rule requires the corporation to submit its application by the end of September 30, 2002—that’s 27 months after June 30:<br><br>

                      . <br>
                      August 31, 2002&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;26 months have passed <br>
                      September 30, 2002&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;27 months have passed&mdash;<b>TIME’S UP!</b><br>
                      <br><br>
                      <b>Impact of late filing.</b> To see the impact of meeting or failing to meet this deadline, suppose the corpora-tion received a donation in July 2000. Let’s consider the four primary possibilities.</p>
                      <table>
                        <tr>
                          <th></th><th>	Meet the Deadline<br>(e.g., file on Sep 29, 2002)</th><th>	Do Not Meet the Deadline<br>(e.g., file on Oct 1, 2002)</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr><td>IRS Recognizes Tax-Exempt Status</td><td>Tax exemption dated 6/14/2000. The donation was deductible.</td><td>Tax exemption dated 10/1/2002. The donation was not deductible.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>IRS Does Not Recognize Tax-Exempt Status</td><td>No tax exemption; the donation was not deductible.</td><td></td></tr>




                    </table>
                      <br><br>
                      If the deadline was met and the IRS recognizes tax exemption, then the donation received on July 2000 will be a deductible donation, meaning that the donor can deduct it from their tax return. In addition, any income that the organization received during that period is not taxable income.
                      <br><br>
                      Late filing has two main consequences: (1) You could be liable for taxes for tax years that closed prior to the tax exemption date, and (2) donations you might have collected might not have been eligible for tax deductions.
                      <br><br>
                      Donors could be unhappy if they took tax deductions for those donations. This is one reason it is im-portant to be clear with potential donors if you do not yet have an official recognition letter. (You can always tell donors you have applied, but you do not want to tell them that you are exempt. It’s up to them to risk a deduction if the nonprofit is not yet officially recognized as tax exempt.)
                      <br><hr>
                      <b>Meeting the Deadline:  Two Options</b>
                      If you file on time, you must decide how to act while waiting for the IRS to respond. There are two op-tions during the waiting period.
                      First, assume that you are not tax-exempt during the waiting period: (1) don’t accept donations or, alter-natively,  accept donations but tell potential donors that they are not tax-deductible contributions; and (2) file ordinary tax returns (normally corporate tax returns, Form 1120) and pay any necessary taxes. If you later receive recognition of tax-exempt status from your formation date, you might be able to get a refund of those taxes.[q]
                      The second option is to assume that you are tax-exempt: (1) accept donations, telling donors that you have applied for tax-exempt recognition but you can’t guarantee it will come throug), and (2) decide whether or not to file a 990 tax-exempt income tax form. (See Do I need to file a 990?)
                      Missing the Deadline
                      If you have missed the 27-month deadline, you can request that the IRS make your exemption retroac-tive to the date of formation or an earlier date. This is done through an “extension of time” request on the Form 1023 application, in Schedule E. The IRS states that “a request [for an extension of time] will be approved if the organization acted reasonably and in good faith, and granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. These standards are usually met if the organization files its application before the failure to file is discovered by the IRS.”[x]
                      The 1023 application, Schedule E notes that even if you did not meet the 27-month deadline for filing a 1023 application—and thus were not a 501(c)(3) from the date of organization—you can check a box and be considered a 501(c)(4) from your date of formation—another kind of tax-exempt nonprofit. A 501(c)(4), however, cannot receive tax-deductible donations. Donors might still be irate, but the nonprof-it might not have any late tax income.[y]
                      When is the application “filed”?
                      Your application is filed when either (a) a hard-copy is postmarked, or (b) if it is not mailed in, the IRS receives it. If you electronically file the application, typically the submission date will be the filing date.
                      What about amendments or changes?
                      It is not uncommon for a 1023 application to require changes or amendments to the application. In gen-eral, if those amendments are not substantive—for example, fixing a clerical error—then the rules above still apply. But “[i]f the [IRS] requires the organization to alter its activities or make substantive amend-ments to its enabling instrument, the exemption will be effective as of the date specified in the determi-nation letter.”[4] The unpredictability of the date of the exemption letter in these circumstances is one reason that many prefer to have an attorney review or draft the application, to reduce the risk of an in-complete application or one that will likely require substantive amendments.
                      What does “formed” mean?
                      The IRS materials use both the terms “formed” or “organized”[5]. The terms aren’t defined in the statute or administrative regulations. Since 1975 the IRS has taken the position that it means the date the state files a nonprofit corporation’s articles with the state.[6]<br><br><hr>
                      <b>Footnotes</b><br>
                      [1] The IRS updates its tax-exempt organization applications annually and often tinkers with them during the year. The most recent version is here Proc. Rev 2017-5, available at  https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-01_IRB/ar11.html.<br>
                      [2] Just about everyone&mdash;including the IRS&mdash;often says that the IRS “grants” tax exemption. Technically the IRS only either recognizes or refuses to recognize tax exemption. <i>Congress</i> grants tax-exemption through statutes.<br>
                      [3] The rule applies to all 501(c) organizations except for “Qualified Nonprofit Health Insurance Issuers.” Id. The rules can be a little more elaborate for certain 501(c) organizations.<br>
                      [4] See Proc. Rev 2017-5, 6.08.3(a).<br>
                      [5] Publication 557 mentions “organized” https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf, p.22 but the application itself says “formed.”<br>
                      [6] Rev. Rul. 75-290, 1975-2 C.B. 215.<br>
                      [x] 26 CFR §301.9100-3<br>
                      [y] The rationale for this 501(c)(4) “look-back” option is mysterious and the IRS rules are. Since 2013 the annual IRS revenue procedures for exempt organizations have been clear that the 27-month rule applies to most 501(c) organizations (including 501(c)(4) organizations). See Rev. Proc. 2013-9, 2013-2 I.R.B. sec. 2.034 and the current Rev. Proc. 2017-5. Since the IRS would apply the 27-month rule to a late-filing 501(c)(4), it is not clear why it would grant 501(c)(4) status to a 501(c)(3) that violated that rule. In addition, 26 USC 506 since mid-2016 requires 501(c)(4) organizations to send a form to the IRS within 60 days of operating as a 501(c)(4) or else pay $20 a day up to $5,000.00. That applies to 501(c)(4)’s that intend to operate as (c)(4) organizations, so it’s possible that the look-back provision still makes sense since the 501(c)(3) isn’t really intending to operate as a (c)(4). Nevertheless, the rationale for the “look-back” option remains unclear.<br>
                      [q] This might require a lawsuit. See Fundamentals, p. 46, n.30. I have not attempted this.<br>
