                      <p>
                      Nonprofits seeking 501(c) tax exempt status should be aware of the IRS “27-month” rule.<sup title="The IRS updates its tax-exempt organization applications annually and often tinkers with them during the year. The most recent version is here Proc. Rev 2017-5, available at  https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-01_IRB/ar11.html.">1</sup> This is an IRS stopwatch that starts the moment a nonprofit is “formed.” (More on "formed," below.)<br><br>
                      <b>The rule.</b> The IRS gives a new 501(c) 27-months from the end of the month that it was formed to submit IRS Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to be recognized as tax exempt.<sup title="Just about everyone&mdash;including the IRS&mdash;often says that the IRS “grants” tax exemption. Technically the IRS only either recognizes or refuses to recognize tax exemption. <i>Congress</i> grants tax-exemption through statutes.">2</sup> This requirement applies to 501(c) organizations in general,<sup title="The rule does not only apply to charities:  &quot;(1) In general. A determination letter recognizing exemption of an organization described in § 501(c), other than § 501(c)(29), is usually effective as of the date of formation of an organization if: (1) its purposes and activities prior to the date of the determination letter have been consistent with the requirements for exemption; (2) it has not failed to file required Form 990 series returns or notices for three consecutive years; and (3) it has filed an application for recognition of exemption within 27 months from the end of the month in which it was organized.&quot; Proc. Rev 2017-5 &sect;&sect; 6.01, 6.08">3</sup> but it can have a big impact on charitable nonprofits.
                      <br><hr><br>
                      <b>Example.</b> Suppose Charitable Doings, an Oregon nonprofit corporation, is formed on June 14, 2000. This charitable nonprofit wants both to be exempt from income tax and to accept donations that donors can deduct from <i>their</i> income taxes.<br><br>The 27-month clock automatically starts on June 30 (the end of that month). The rule requires the corporation to submit its application by the end of September 30, 2002—that’s 27 months after June 30:<br><br>

                    </table>
                      <br><br>
                      <p>If the deadline was met and the IRS recognizes tax exemption, then the donation received on July 30, 2000 will be a deductible donation&mdash;the donor can deduct it from their tax return. In addition, any income that the organization received during the pre-filing period is not taxable income.
                      <br><hr><br>
                      Late filing has <b>two main consequences:</b> (1) The organization may owe taxes for for years that closed prior to the tax-exemption date, and (2) donations received before that date might not have been eligible for tax deductions.
                      <br><br>
                      <i>Donors might be unhappy if they took tax deductions for those donations!</i><br><br>
                      This is one reason to be clear with potential donors if you do not yet have an  letter from the IRS officially recognizing the organization as tax-exempt. (You can always tell donors you have <i>applied</i> for exemption, but you do not want to tell them that you <i>are</i> exempt. It’s up to the donor to risk a deduction if the nonprofit is not yet officially recognized as tax exempt.)
                      <br><hr>
                      <b>MEETING the Deadline:  Two Options</b>
                      If you file on time, you must decide how to act while waiting for the IRS to respond. There are two options during the waiting period.<br><br>
                      <b>First</b>, assume that you are not tax-exempt during the waiting period: (1) don’t accept donations or, alternatively,  accept donations but tell potential donors that they are not tax-deductible contributions; and (2) file ordinary tax returns (normally corporate tax returns, Form 1120) and pay any necessary taxes. If you later receive recognition of tax-exempt status from your formation date, you might be able to get a refund of those taxes.<sup title="Or so legend has it. I have not attempted this and the IRS rules are difficult to parse, so the mechanics of getting a refund appear unclear.">4</sup><br><br>
                      <b>Second</b>, assume that you are tax-exempt: (1) accept donations, telling donors that you have applied for tax-exempt recognition but you can’t guarantee it will come through), and (2) decide whether or not to file a 990 tax-exempt income tax form.<br><hr><br>
                      <b>MISSING the Deadline:  Asking for An Extension of Time</b>
                      If you missed the 27-month deadline, you can request that the IRS make your exemption retroactive to the date of formation or an earlier date. This is done through an <b>extension of time request</b> on the Form 1023 application in Schedule E. The IRS states that “a request [for an extension of time] will be approved if the organization acted reasonably and in good faith, and granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. These standards are usually met if the organization files its application before the failure to file is discovered by the IRS.”<sup title="26 CFR &sect; 301.9100-3.">5</sup><br><br>
                      Schedule E of the 1023 application notes that even if you did not meet the 27-month deadline for filing a 1023 application&mdash;and thus were not a 501(c)(3) from the date of organization&mdash;you can check a box and be considered a 501(c)(4) from your date of formation—another kind of tax-exempt nonprofit. A 501(c)(4), however, cannot receive tax-deductible donations. Donors might still be irate, but the nonprofit might get avoid backtaxes and penalties for late income tax.<sup title="26 CFR &sect; 301.9100-3.">6</sup><br><hr><br>

                      <b>When is the application “filed”?</b>
                      Your application is filed when either a hard-copy is postmarked, or when the IRS receives it if it's not mailed. If you electronically file the application, typically the submission date will be the filing date.<br><br>
                      <b>What about amendments or changes?</b> It is not uncommon for a 1023 application to require changes or amendments. In general, only minor changes&mdash;for example, fixing a clerical error&mdash;mean that the rules above still apply. But “[i]f the [IRS] requires the organization to alter its activities or make substantive amendments to its enabling instrument, the exemption will be effective as of the date specified in the determination letter.”<sup title="See Proc. Rev 2017-5 &sect; 6.08.3(a).">7</sup><br><br>

                      <b>What does “formed” mean?</b> The IRS materials use both the terms “formed” or “organized” and occasionally "established."<sup title="Publication 557 mentions &quot;organized&quot; https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf, p.22 but the application itself says &quot;formed.&quot;">8</sup>. Since 1975 the IRS has taken the position that it means the date the state files a nonprofit corporation’s articles with the state.<sup title="Rev. Rul. 75-290, 1975-2 C.B. 215.">9</sup><br><br>

                      <b>501(c)(4) special rule.</b> 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organizations should be aware of a new, additional timing rule&mdash;a strict 60-days-after-formation rule. I will discuss that in my next post.

                      <b>Footnotes</b><br><br>
                      [1] The IRS updates its tax-exempt organization applications annually and often tinkers with them during the year. The most recent version is here Proc. Rev 2017-5, available at  https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-01_IRB/ar11.html.<br><br>
                      [2] Just about everyone&mdash;including the IRS&mdash;often says that the IRS “grants” tax exemption. Technically the IRS only either recognizes or refuses to recognize tax exemption. <i>Congress</i> grants tax-exemption through statutes.<br><br>
                      [3] The rule does not only apply to charities:  &quot;(1) In general. A determination letter recognizing exemption of an organization described in § 501(c), other than § 501(c)(29), is usually effective as of the date of formation of an organization if: (1) its purposes and activities prior to the date of the determination letter have been consistent with the requirements for exemption; (2) it has not failed to file required Form 990 series returns or notices for three consecutive years; and (3) it has filed an application for recognition of exemption within 27 months from the end of the month in which it was organized.&quot; Proc. Rev 2017-5 &sect;&sect; 6.01, 6.08.<br><br>
                      [4] Or so legend has it. I have not attempted this and the IRS rules are difficult to parse, so the mechanics of getting a refund appear unclear.<br><br>
                      [5] 26 CFR &sect; 301.9100-3.<br><br>
                      [6] The rationale for this 501(c)(4) “look-back” option is mysterious and the IRS rules are. Since 2013 the annual IRS revenue procedures for exempt organizations have been clear that the 27-month rule applies to most 501(c) organizations (including 501(c)(4) organizations). See Rev. Proc. 2013-9, 2013-2 I.R.B. sec. 2.034 and the current Rev. Proc. 2017-5. Since the IRS would apply the 27-month rule to a late-filing 501(c)(4), it is not clear why it would grant 501(c)(4) status to a 501(c)(3) that violated that rule. In addition, 26 USC 506 since mid-2016 requires 501(c)(4) organizations to send a form to the IRS within 60 days of operating as a 501(c)(4) or else pay $20 a day up to $5,000.00. That applies to 501(c)(4)’s that intend to operate as (c)(4) organizations, so it’s possible that the look-back provision still makes sense since the 501(c)(3) isn’t really intending to operate as a (c)(4). Nevertheless, the rationale for the “look-back” option remains unclear.<br><br>
